First I’d put <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> on my page. I’d have at least 4 breakpoints, for screen sizes  320(mobile), 768(tablet), 1024(browser), 1440(browser).  I’d use fluid grids with columns which are based on using percentage values and I’d define the appropriate size in media queries for all mentioned screens. I’d avoid fixed height and width for all elements on page, as well as using pixels on page. For tablets and phones, I wouldn’t display the Dashboard>main>Home. Instead of that, I’d put the column with search box to take 100% of the screen (max-width:100%). For the menu bar for small screens I’d set position relative and I’d have icon which position will be absolute and which will be located right on the screen. I’d use media queries to hide all except the first item in navigation bar by using display none. When the user clicks on menu icon, he’d see the vertical menu bar which would have text-align:left , with no float. In cases of bigger screens, the links inside menu would have float left property.Also I would style elements to be larger and easier to press with a fingertip on touchscreen devices.  For the sidebar which is located on the left side of the screen, I’d set for tablets and phones max-width:100% property. Also, for the main div I’d set to go below this one, I’d also set to take whole width for smaller screens, and I’d remove the picture for phones and tablets.  For font, I’d use the unit “vw” which follows the size of the browser, or I’d define specific size of fonts  inside all breakpoints.
