First thing i would do is separting class ContactPerson into own file. Also i would store values for ContactPerson in database, including separated tables for County and Municipality. I would also create new method  for selecting all ContactPersons which will return List<ContactPerson>. In that way we would only need to call this method from PopulateContactList() method in cs. The method will be in ContactPerson class where i would store all methods related to this object.  The similar thing is with PopulateCountyList(). I would create separate method for selecting county and method above will only call that method from cs file. In this way we will hide the implementation of the methods.  Next step transferring methods  PopulateMunicipalityByCounty and GetMunicipalityforEmail to ContactPerson class and refactoring them and then calling them from cs file. Also methods GetAttachments(), BuildMail(),SendMail() and BuildMailContent also do not belong to this form cs file and they should be transferred to their relevant classes. My conclusion is that all methods mentioned above should not be implemented in cs file of web form, they should all be transferred to relevant classes or transferred to new unique class which will contain all business logic methods and which will communicate with data layer of application. Also I think that BuildMailContent method can much more simplified. All this changes would make code cleaner and application much easier to maintain.
